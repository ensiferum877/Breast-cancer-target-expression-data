# Breast-cancer-target-expression-data

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive workflow designed to extract molecular data such as target cellular location and gene expression data from the open targets platform, with a specific focus on **breast cancer**. The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook containing in-depth data processing scripts, alongside a Streamlit web application for interactive data exploration.

## Features

**Data Processing Scripts:** The Jupyter Notebook (LLMtoSQLforBioData.ipynb) includes detailed scripts for querying, processing, and transforming gene expression data.

**Differential Expression data:** The notebook queries differential expression data powered by Expression atlas and made it available via the open targets platform.

**Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:** The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for dynamic data filtering, visualization, and exploration.

## Web app

The streamlit app can be accessed through the following address: https://ensiferum877-breast-cancer-target-expression-bioinfo-app-hu2ies.streamlit.app
Alternatively, the repository can be cloned and the app can be launched locally.
